# 🚀 CDK Web Infra Setup

This project demonstrates how to deploy a simple static web infrastructure using AWS CDK.  
It's designed for cases where you need to **move to a new AWS account** and want to bootstrap essential infrastructure automatically.

---

## 🔧 What’s included

- 🛠 **GitHub** as the source control  
- 🧪 **CodePipeline** to orchestrate the CI/CD process  
- 🧱 **CodeBuild** for building and exporting the Next.js app  
- 📦 **S3** for hosting the exported static site  
- 🌐 **CloudFront** for caching & secure distribution  
- 🔔 **SNS** for pipeline notifications  
- 📁 **Environment-specific config** with YAML files like `dev.yaml`, `uat.yaml`, etc.

## 🗂 Directory Structure

```bash
.
├── lib/
│   └── cdk-demo-stack.ts       # Main CDK stack
│   └── source/config/
│       ├── dev.yaml            # Config for dev
│       ├── uat.yaml            # Config for UAT
├── buildspec.yaml              # CodeBuild spec
├── README.md                   # This file
```

## 🧙 How it works

1. **Read Config**  
   Reads environment-specific config file like `dev.yaml`.

2. **S3 Bucket**  
   - Creates a bucket (if not exists)  
   - Blocks public access  
   - Adds project/env tags
   - Attach explicit s3:GetObject permission for CloudFront using bucket policy

3. **CloudFront**  
   - Linked to S3 with OAC (Origin Access Control)  
   - Custom cache policy  
   - Error handling: show `/index.html` for 403/404

4. **CodeBuild**  
   - Using existing IAM role
   - Runs `next build` + `next export`  
   - Deploys to S3 bucket

5. **CodePipeline**  
   - Triggers from GitHub  
   - Connects to CodeBuild  
   - Sends result to SNS

## 🚀 Deploy

> You can pass the environment (e.g. `dev`, `uat`) as a context variable

```bash
cdk deploy --context env=dev
```

Built with ☕, 💪, 🧘‍♀️, 🎶 and too many failed deployments (I lost count)...
